# PyRPG

Just a simple little text-based RPG crawler, written in Python. This project was born out of an instructional lesson
I did for a friend teaching them the basics of programming in Python.

Since then I added a few more little bits of functionality. Might expand it later... who knows.

# Installation 

```
1. Download the source files.
2. Run main.py with Python
3. Create a character.
4. Type help for list of available commands.
